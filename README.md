Contact App :-
              In a project, lists can be used to store and manage collections of data, such as a list of contacts. 
              For instance, each contact can be a dictionary with keys like 'name', 'phone', and 'email', and 
              the list can store these dictionaries. This allows for efficient management and retrieval of contact information.

              Lists support various operations such as indexing, slicing, appending, and removing elements. 
              You can access elements using indices, where the first element has an index of 0.   
                  Lists can be manipulated using built-in methods using like :-
                    append(), extend(), insert(), remove(), pop().
